## Overview

- This is the frontend of a website developed using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The design is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experiences across various devices and screen sizes.
- Next.js empowers developers to build high-performance web applications by offering features like Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR). With built-in image optimization, automatic code splitting, and support for TypeScript, Next.js ensures fast load times, reduced bundle sizes, and improved developer productivity. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

## Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Installation
- Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/nikamaish/NextJS-Frontend.git
```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
 
run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
